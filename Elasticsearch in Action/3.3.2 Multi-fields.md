# 3.3.2 Multi-fields
If arrays let you index more data with the same settings, multi-fields are about indexing the same data multiple times using different settings. For example, in listing 3.4 you configure the tags field from your posts’ type with two different settings: analyzed, for matches on every word, and not_analyzed, for exact matches on the full tag name.

TIP You can upgrade a single field to a multi-field configuration without needing to re-index your data. This is what happens if you’ve already created a tags string field before you run the following listing. The opposite isn’t possible, though: you can’t remove a sub-field from the mapping once it’s there.

startgroup
```
% curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/blog/_mapping/posts' -d '{
  "posts" : {
    "properties" : {
      "tags" : {
        "type": "string",
        "index": "analyzed",
        "fields": {
          "verbatim": {
            "type": "string",
            "index": "not_analyzed"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```
endgroup

You search in the analyzed version of the tags field as you do with any other string. To search in the not_analyzed version (and get back only exact matches on the original tag), specify the full path: tags.verbatim.

Both multi-field and array field types let you have multiple core type values in a single field. Next, we’ll look at predefined fields (which are normally handled by Elasticsearch on its own) to add new functionality to your documents, such as automatically expiring them.
