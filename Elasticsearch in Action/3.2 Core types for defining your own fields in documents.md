# 3.2 Core types for defining your own fields in documents
With Elasticsearch, a field can be one of the core types (see table 3.1), such as a string or a number, or it can be a more complex type derived from core types, such as an array.

There are some additional types not covered in this chapter. For example, there’s the nested type, which allows you to have documents within documents, or the geo_point type, which stores a location on Earth based on its longitude and latitude. We’ll discuss those additional types in chapter 8, where we cover relationships among documents, and in appendix A, where we discuss geospatial data.

Ngoài ra còn một số type khác phức tạp hơn nhưng sẽ ko được học ở chapter này như: nested, geo_point

NOTE In addition to the fields you define in your documents, such as name or date, Elasticsearch uses a set of predefined fields to enrich them. For example, there’s a _all field, where all the document’s fields are indexed together. This is useful when users search for something without specifying the field they can search in all fields. These predefined fields have their own configuration options, and we’ll discuss them later in this chapter.

Let’s look at each of these core types so you can make good mapping choices when you index your own data.
